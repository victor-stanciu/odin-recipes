    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Summon the flavors of the gods with Asgard Curry — a bold and hearty dish worthy of a Viking feast. Infused with warming spices, tender meat, and rich, golden sauce, this legendary curry will conquer your hunger!</p><br>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 kg diced lamb or beef (or chicken if preferred)</strong> – the heart of the beast</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp vegetable oil </strong>– for searing</li>
        <li><strong>2 large onions, finely chopped </strong>– eyes of the all-seeing ravens</li>
        <li><strong>4 cloves garlic, minced </strong>– the breath of the gods</li>
        <li><strong>1 thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger, grated </strong>– fire from the forge</li>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp curry powder </strong>– the golden dust of far-off realms</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh coriander or parsley, chopped</strong> – green of Yggdrasil</li>
        <li><strong>Salt & black pepper</strong>, to taste...</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>Forging the Asgard Curry:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sear the Meat</strong></li>
        Heat oil in a large iron pot. Brown the meat on all sides over high heat — seal in the strength of the beast. Remove and set aside.
        <li><strong>Build the Base</strong></li>
        In the same pot, lower the heat. Add chopped onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook until soft and golden — this is the flavor hearth.
        <li><strong>Add the Spices</strong></li>
        Stir in curry powder, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and chili flakes. Let the spices awaken for 1–2 minutes, until their aroma fills the hall.
        <li><strong>Summon the Sauce</strong></li>
        Return the meat to the pot. Pour in chopped tomatoes and coconut milk. Stir well, season with salt and pepper, then let it simmer on low heat for 45–60 minutes — until the meat is tender and the sauce thickens.
        <li><strong>Feast Like a Viking</strong></li>
        Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve hot over rice or with flatbread. Garnish with fresh herbs and eat like the gods of Asgard.
