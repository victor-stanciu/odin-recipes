 <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Beware the bite of Fenrir Cake — a deceptively sweet creation cloaked in white, hiding the wild spirit of the great wolf within. With soft, spiced layers and a luscious vanilla frosting, it is a treat forged for feasts... feared by the gods, devoured by mortals.</p><br>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>200g unsalted butter, softened </strong>– churned by shieldmaidens</li>
        <li><strong>200g sugar </strong>– sweetness stolen from the gods</li>
        <li><strong>3 large eggs </strong>– heart of the beast</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp vanilla extract </strong>– song of the Valkyries</li>
        <li><strong>250g plain flour </strong>– dust from the fields of Midgard</li>
        <li><strong>150g cream cheese </strong>– soft bite of Fenrir</li>
        <li><strong>120ml milk </strong>– white as snow in Jotunheim</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>Forging the Fenrir Cake:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Raise the Beast</strong></li>
        Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy — the howl before the storm. Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by vanilla.
        <li><strong>Mix the Foundation</strong></li>
        In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom (or nutmeg), and salt. Add to the wet mix in parts, alternating with milk, until smooth.
        <li><strong>Bake the Form</strong></li>
        Pour into a greased 20cm round cake tin. Bake at 175°C (350°F) for 25–30 minutes, until golden and firm like the chains that held Fenrir. Let it cool completely.
        <li><strong>Whip the Frost</strong></li>
        Beat cream cheese and butter together until smooth. Add vanilla, then sift in powdered sugar and beat until the frosting is thick like a winter blizzard.
        <li><strong>Unleash and Adorn</strong></li>
        Frost the cooled cake generously. Swirl the top like a snowstorm over a battlefield. Optionally, decorate with shards of toasted nuts or silver sprinkles — the teeth of Fenrir.
